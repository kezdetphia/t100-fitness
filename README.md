Personal Trainer Portfolio App

Welcome to the Personal Trainer Portfolio App! This project is designed to help personal trainers introduce themselves to potential clients, showcase their price list and services, display their social media links, and provide a contact form for clients to get in touch. This README will guide you through the app's features, installation, customization, and deployment on Vercel.

Features

    Personal Trainer Introduction: A dedicated section for personal trainers to introduce themselves, including their name, a brief bio, and a profile picture.
    Service Showcase: Display a list of services offered, along with their descriptions and prices.
    Social Media Links: Share links to your social media profiles to connect with clients on different platforms.
    Contact Form: Integrated a contact form using the EmailJS package, allowing clients to send emails directly to the personal trainer.

Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and stylish designs.
    EmailJS: A service for sending email directly from client-side JavaScript applications.
